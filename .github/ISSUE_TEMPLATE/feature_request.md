about: Suggest an idea for this mod

**Follow the below guidelines**

**Is it something to do with downgrading to another MC version?**
No downgrades. Previous versions will not and will never be supported.

**Does it make sense?**
It should make sense in the context of this mod.

**Is it not ridiculously hard to code?**
Don't ask me to write a magic or energy system or whatever. This mod is a one man team.

**Is it already on the 'planned features' page in the wiki?**
Go check it.

**Has it already been suggested?**
Go check it.

If your request does not fit the above criteria...please reconsider. If it does and you choose to submit a request, I will consider, but I am only one person and I am not sure how much I can handle. For reasonable requests, I will add them to the planned features page.
