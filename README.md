# Project: Vibrant Journeys

Project: Vibrant Journeys is a Minecraft mod that aims to add some spice to survival without changing its core aspects. Instead of adding tons of new content in one direction, this mod focuses on adding content that overlays the current style of survival. Here, you will not find complex machinery, or magical spells, or a billion biomes, or too many dimensions to remember. You will find new building materials, new places to explore, and new monsters to slay. It does not aim to revamp or change the focus of survival, but rather to enhance it.

**See the wiki for details on the mod!**

-------------------------------------------------

The current version was built with Minecraft 1.12.2 and MinecraftForge v14.23.4.2705.

**Cascading World Gen Issues**

You will see these errors pop up in the log, especially when generating willow swamps and redwoods for the first time. Depending on how many mods you have or how strong your PC is, it may lag your game. Sometimes it is easy to fix, but not always, especially when it comes to large trees. I try to fix as much as I can.

**FAQ**

No, I will not make this for xyz Minecraft version. Please don't stay at versions like 1.7.10 because "the mods I use are still in 1.7.10".
