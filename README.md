# Project: Vibrant Journeys

Project: Vibrant Journeys is a Minecraft mod that aims to add some spice to survival without changing its core aspects. Instead of adding tons of new content in one direction, this mod focuses on adding content that overlays the current style of survival. Here, you will not find complex machinery, or magical spells, or a billion biomes, or too many dimensions to remember. You will find new building materials, new places to explore, and new monsters to slay. It does not aim to revamp or change the focus of survival, but rather to enhance it.

See the wiki for details on the mod!

-------------------------------------------------

The current build runs on MinecraftForge v14.23.4.2705.
If you have any questions or find any bugs/issues, feel free to submit a new issue in the repository or comment on either the PlanetMinecraft thread or MinecraftForum thread. Any issues relating to a game crash MUST post the crash log and how to replicate the crash, or else I cannot help you!
